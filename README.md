# DrZ-Configs
DrZ's Configs to be used on Necrobot.
Currently updated for: Necrobot v0.8.3.
If you have issues, I left the v0.8.2 package and MassEXP 0.8.1.

Changelog:
-EXP rates have been pumped up even more from 0.8.0.
-High Caliber Sniper Rifle has been cleaned up, should shoot and give less problems + increased base EXP rate!
-LocationFeeder is a standalone file, for easier updates to filter out fake coords, etc. It has been added to full package too.
(They run my own discord_channels.json config)
P.S. MassEXP will now snipe quite a few Pokemon whenever it can, happy botting with just 1 config :) (Sniper does this too now!)

BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH 0.8.1 IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING ISSUES!

Enjoy :)


***Please read the in-line documentation on all the configs.json to avoid any mistakes/errors.
