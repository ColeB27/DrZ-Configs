# DrZ-Configs
DrZ's Configs to be used on Necrobot.
Currently updated for: Necrobot v0.8.0.

Changelog:
-EXP rates have been pumped up.
-High Caliber Sniper Rifle has been cleaned up, should shoot and give less problems.
-LocationFeeder is a standalone file, for easier updates to filter out fake coords, etc.
P.S. MassEXP will now snipe quite a few Pokemon whenever it can, happy botting with just 1 config :)

Enjoy :)


***Please read the in-line documentation on all the configs.json to avoid any mistakes/errors.
